Redux-

Core concepts of redux consists of -
1.Store- Holds state of your application.
2.Action- Describe the changes in the state of the application
3.Reducer -Actually carries out the state transition depending on the action.

Eample- Book Shop
 (Store)                  (Reducer)              (Action)
  Shop<====================>ShopKeeper<============>Customer



  Rules of Redux-
  1. The state of redux is stored in an object tree within a single store.
  {
    NumberofBooks:10
  }

  2.Only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
  {type:"BuyBook"}

  3.To specify , how the state tree is transformed by actions, we write pure reducer.
